# Overview

Welcome to the Smart Soil documentation. Our web application, built with Django and basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is designed to assist farmers.

## Vision

Smart Soil enables farmers to upload field locations and soil pictures. The application analyzes these images and provides recommendations on tools, medicine, crops, capital, estimated time, and more.

## Quick Setup

1. Configure your IP address and add it to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the `Smart_Soil.settings` file.
2. Set `DEBUG` to `False` for optimal performance.

## Strict Configuration Rule

1. Create an account and add your data to our database to use the analysis function.

## Current Issues

- Not fully reliable
- Performance is inconsistent
- Incomplete relative to our vision on the website
